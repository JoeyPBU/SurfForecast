## Design Inspiration

The primary design inspiration for this project came from weather apps. The goal was to combine their clean, user-friendly layouts with a surferâ€™s need for clear, concise forecasting information. Special care was taken to ensure all elements, from the carousel to the wave background, align with this philosophy.
